I think everybody should do fitness, because taking care of your body is essential for a healthy life. Fitness can be fun and entertaining and will make you feel better than ever. Some people think it is boring, but they are wrong and sometimes full of pain. Treat the body the way it deserves like a temple.

      Well maybe you thought you will find something like starting strength here, but you are wrong. I use a mix of kettlebells, clubbells and calisthenics for my training regime. Because itâ€™s cheaper and doesn't use too much space.
      </p>
      <h3>My routine:</h3>
     I start with kettlebell swings starting with 10x10 and every day increase the rep by one. After 20x10 i increase the weight. For the other kettlebell exercises i start with 5x3 and increase the rep by one everyday until i reach 12x3 and then i increase the weight. For the heavy club exercises i do the different movements until i am tired. Wednesday is my recovery day so i do 20x3 burpees, pull ups 12x3 and handstand training. So I can do handstand push ups in the future.

        Diet is one of the most important things in fitness, 
        i personally think that it is even more important than exercise. 
        Having a good diet increases your mood but also it affects stuff like your energy levels and your skin.
        I will keep this short because sometimes it changes depending on the mood of my taste buds. So it is just a list of ingredients that i eat and the supplements that i use.
