    I think everbody should do fitness, because taking care of your body is essential for an healty living. Fitness can be fun and entertaining and will make you feel better than ever. Some people think it is boring, but they are wrong and sometimes full of pain. Treat the body the way it deserves like a temple.

      Well maybe you tought you will find something like starting strenght here, but you are wrong. I use a mix of kettlebells, clubbells and calistenics for my regime. 
      </p>
      <h3>My routine:</h3>
      I start Kettlebell Swings with 10x10 and every day increase the rep by one. After 20x10 i increase the weight. For the other kettebell exercises i start with 5x3 and increase the rep by one everyday until i reach 12x3 and then i increase the weight. For the heavy club exercises i do the different movements until i am tired. Wednesday is my recovery day so i do 20x3 burpees and pull ups 12x3 and handstand training.
