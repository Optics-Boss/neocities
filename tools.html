      <p>Here i will post the tools that i use for creating this website.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Neovim</b> <br>
      I use neovim to code this website, i think it is the best text editor ever made.
      Because it is lightweight and it is the only thing that makes me code as fast as i can think.      The waiting time in some other text editors and IDE's is sometimes too long for me. But there is always a downside and that is if you are trying a new language installing and configuring a new lsp is not always that good and sometimes it doens't work. I am also trying to learn Emacs to see if it actually better, but in the mean time this is the best i have ever seen. Also if i use a different text editor or ide. I always install the vim motions plugin.

      <p>
      <b>Aseprite</b><br />
      I am using this piece of software to make pixel art for this website. I am also learning pixel art. There a lot of software that can make pixel art. But this is specifically created for pixel art. It is a small and easy piece of software to use. Also i want to use this software for making games or animations later. But first learn basic pixel art</p>
