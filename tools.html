      <p>Here i will post the tools that i use for creating this website.</p>
      <p>
      <b>Neovim</b> <br>
         I use Neovim to code this website, i think it is the best text editor ever made.
         Because it is lightweight and it is the only thing that makes me code as fast as i can think.
         The loading time in other text editors and IDE's is sometimes too slow for me.
         But there is always a downside and that is if you are trying a new programming language and when you need to install the lsp for it.
         The lsp sometimes doesn't work and you need to spend time debugging it.
         I’m also trying to learn Emacs to see if it is actually better, but in the mean time this is the best i have ever seen.
         Also if you see me using a different text editor or IDE then i always install the vim motions plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Aseprite</b> <br>
      I’m using Aseprite to make pixel art for this website. There is a lot of software out there that can make pixel art. But Aseprite is specifically created for pixel art. It’s a small and easy piece of software to use. Also i want to use Aseprite for making games and/or animations later.
